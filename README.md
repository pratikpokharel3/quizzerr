# Quizzer | Test Your Knowledge In Programming

A place to test your knowledge and skill in different programming languages. The quiz consists of total 25 questions with a time limit of 5 minutes. Try to get a perfect score of 25/25.

You can extend this app by adding more features to it like adding category section to quizes, time limit for each question, a scoreboard to see the list of users who have taken the quiz with their respective scores, etc. just to name a few.

Now, build something great!

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases, this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports, you can enable Volar's Take Over mode.
